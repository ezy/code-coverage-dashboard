# ðŸš¦ Code Coverage Dashboard

A simple dashboard for [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) code coverage reports designed to be deployed to Heroku. The app takes any `coverage-summary.json` input file hosted within a folder on github and displays the data in a set of easily configurable chart components. Works great for a dev team to see their code coverage improving over time.

## Quick start

- Setup [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) to export a `json-summary` report with datestamp.
- Upload `coverage-summary-1534886771995.json` to a folder in the github repo you want to display.
- Add the folder location of your `json-summary` report in .env `REACT_APP_DATA_DIR_URL`.
- Build to Heroku.
- The app will check hourly for a new file in `REACT_APP_DATA_DIR_URL`.
- If the filename is different (eg. `coverage-summary-1534886791867.json`) the line chart will update.

## Istanbul setup

Reports are generated from the `json-summary` report by Istanbul. There's an example `isantbul.yml` file in the project directory that includes report settings for `html` and `json-summary` reports. In order for your filename changes to be picked up you can timeStamp the `coverage-sumary.json` file by using the following script in your `package.json` file:

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "covdate": "mv coverage/coverage-summary.json coverage/coverage-summary-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).json"
  }
}
```

## Configuring reports

There are three different report charts that are displayed: A dateTime based **line chart** displaying total statement coverage; a summary of total coverage values as **donut charts**; and a group of **stack charts** that display coverage for individual and grouped report strings.

### Line chart

The line chart component is located at `src/components/LineChart.js`. It takes an array of values from `localStorage` and displays them as date (X axis) and value (Y axis) from the object input: `{value: 96.75, date: "2018-08-21T04:13:07.414Z"}`. All localStorage values are loaded in the `src/templates/App.js` file.

### Donut chart

The donut chart is fixed and takes the JSON fetched from `coverage-summary.json` as `data` props. It's currently hard-coded to display the percentage of the report totals with the `selectName` property for the corresponding nested key in the `total` object.

eg. `<DonutChart selectName="statements" data={this.state.data} />`

### Stack chart

The stack charts take the JSON fetched from `coverage-summary.json` as `data` props. They take a second property `fileSet` that can be specified as all or part of the object key strings in `coverage-summary.json`. The stack chart will display the average coverage for an keys that match the `fileSet` property.

eg. `<StackChart fileSet="server/user" data={this.state.data} />`

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.
