# ðŸš¦ Code Coverage Dashboard

A simple dashboard for Istanbul code coverage reports designed to be deployed to Heroku. The app takes a `coverage-summary.json` input file and displays coverage charts that are all configurable.

## Istanbul setup

Reports are generated from the `json-summary` report generated by Istanbul. There's an example `isantbul.yml` file in the project directory that includes report settings for `html` and `json-summary` reports.

## Configuring Reports

There are three different report charts that are displayed: A time based line chart; a summary of total coverage as donut charts; and a group of stack charts that display coverage for individual and grouped report strings.

### Line chart

The line chart is located at `src/components/LineChart.js`.
